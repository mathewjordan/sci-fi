IMDB for this movie: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052646/

(p.s. I&#x27;m not calling this the uncut version because the uncut version, according to wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brain_That_Wouldn%27t_Die#DVD_releases), is 85 min. long and wasn&#x27;t shown in theaters. This version is widely accepted as extended)

The AVI File is Marked as DivX but is in fact an AVI with a wmv2 codec (So that it will play in wmp without a codec pack)

EDIT: I have uploaded a .torrent file. Please, if you could, download it and seed for everyone so that everyone else can have a faster downloading experience."/><meta property="og:title" content="The Brain That Wouldn&#x27;t Die Theatrical Version (82 min.) - Untitled"/><meta property="og:description" content="This is The Brain That Wouldn&#x27;t Die, but this is a better transfer than what I have seen on the Archive with all 82 min, plus this is widescreen, unlike most of the other copies on the Archive.
