Curse of the Swamp Creature is a rehash of 1957&#x27;s Voodoo Woman.

A mad scientist works in the middle of the swamp to create a monster that will serve his bidding.  The actor playing the scientist is a ham of the highest order, and everyone else (including especially our hero, John Agar) is a block of wood.

Buchanan&#x27;s signature editing style is in evidence here -- shots cut together that no rational mind can possibly connect to each other in either space or time, presented as &quot;different angles&quot; of the same scene. While it is indisputably bad, it is far from his wackiest editing adventure.
