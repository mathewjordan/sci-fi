This new feature is a mini vampire festival. It has &quot;Grave of the Vampire&quot; from my original Week 7, but I included a bunch of Hammer movie trailers for various Dracula flicks. So, this is not a double feature, just some trailers, a Bugs Bunny cartoon, some nifty advertisements and &quot;Grave of the Vampire&quot;!

For those of you lucky enough to have downloaded the original Week 7, consider yourself blessed; and, the rest of you - enjoy our REVISED Shocker Internet Drive In Week 7 REDO.
