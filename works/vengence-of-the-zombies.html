He&#x27;d appear as a mummy, Count Dracula, a deranged hunchback, and his most famous role of Waldemar Daninsky, the doomed werewolf. After directing several successful &quot;El Hombre Lobo&quot; romps for Naschy, León Klimovsky was back on hand for this undead entry, known in Spain as LA REBELION DE LAS MUERTAS. Naschy takes on two roles; an East Indian guru named Krishna and his scarred brother Kantaka, who uses some kind of voodoo to bring back the dead and haunt a redheaded British woman (Romy, who looks great in a pink nightgown) after her father gets the hatchet in the head. 

Like Klimovsky&#x27;s DR. JEKYLL AND THE WOLFMAN, some of this film was shot on location in London, the city where it takes place in. Anyone expecting George Romero-inspired antics should look elsewhere. Klimovsky&#x27;s zombies are mainly female actresses in black cloaks and blue face make-up who stroll around and grin a lot (they look something like the vamps in Andy Milligan&#x27;s ultra-cheap THE BODY BENEATH).
