(IMDB.COM Description)
An unauthorized production of Bram Stoker&#x27;s work (The legal heirs didn&#x27;t give their permission), so the names had to be changed. But this wasn&#x27;t enough: The widow of Bram Stoker won two lawsuits (1924 and 1929) in which she demanded the destruction of all copies of the movie, however happily copies of it were already too widespread to destroy them all. Later, Universal studios could break her resistance against this movie. Count Orlok&#x27;s move to Wisburg (Obviously the real &quot;Wismar&quot;) brings the plague traceable to his dealings with the Realtor Thomas Hutter, and the Count&#x27;s obsession with Hutter&#x27;s wife, Ellen the only one with the power to end the evil.

DVD Empire Description

A Symphony Of Horror

A long time ago in middle Europe, a decrepit, forbidding castle stood... Casting an ominous shadow over the townspeople who dare not look upon it, the unholy dwelling is home to one Count Orlok (Max Schreck) , an undead night creature with a taste for human blood.

Into this picture steps Hutter, an unwary traveler who visits the Count. He carries with him the deed for a property Orlock wishes to buy in Hutter&#x27;s home town of Wisborg.

That night, in preparation for the long sea voyage ahead, the vampire hastily loads his coffin aboard ship and waits...

Once at sea, Orlock bares his fangs and upon arrival in Wisborg, leaves behind a floating morgue. Now, preparing to feast on the citizens, the cadaveous Count, prowls the darkness as the eerie Nosferatu."/><meta property="og:title" content="Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens (A Symphony of Horror) - Untitled"/><meta property="og:description" content="This is the most complete version available (just over 93 minutes) as this movie was demanded by Bram Stokers widow to be destroyed after winning 2 lawsuits in the mid &amp; late 1920&#x27;s.
