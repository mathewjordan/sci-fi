The color in the picture was nicer but the sound was very low.

Picture is slightly better.

&lt;b&gt;Differences&lt;/b&gt;

The soundtrack has been remastered with higher volume levels, parametric EQ to help with any high-end cracking, bass boost to the low end, and some de-noising and de-crackling. It&#x27;s not perfect but it&#x27;s much better. Combined with the enhanced color it makes for a more enjoyable cheesy film experience.

The picture has been slightly enhanced but not much. The only thing missing is possible frame stabilization.

IMDb Summary:  A misguided scientist enables an alien from Venus named Zontar to come to Earth in order to help solve man&#x27;s problems. However, Zontar has other ideas, like disabling the power supply of the entire world and taking possession of important officials with mind control devices."/><meta property="og:title" content="Zontar the Thing from Venus (Restored) - Untitled"/><meta property="og:description" content="This version of Zontar is based on &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.org/details/ZontarTheThingFromVenus&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; version.
