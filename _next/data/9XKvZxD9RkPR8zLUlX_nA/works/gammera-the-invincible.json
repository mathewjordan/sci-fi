Gamera wastes no time in causing a rampage of destruction, first destroying a Japanese research ship, then making its way to Japan to wreak havoc. In an attempt to stop the giant turtle, Gamera is sedated with a freezing agent on a precipice, and powerful explosives are placed at the base.

The plan is successful and the Earth is safe from Gamera."]},"rights":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/","homepage":[{"id":"https://archive.org/details/gammera","type":"Text","label":{"en":["Item Page on Internet Archive"]},"format":"text/html"}],"items":[{"id":"https://iiif.archive.org/iiif/gammera/gamera/canvas","type":"Canvas","label":{"none":["gamera"]},"height":368,"width":495,"duration":5121.88,"items":[{"id":"https://iiif.archive.org/iiif/gammera/gamera/page","type":"AnnotationPage","items":[{"id":"https://iiif.archive.org/iiif/gammera/gamera/annotation","type":"Annotation","motivation":"painting","body":{"type":"Choice","items":[{"id":"https://archive.org/download/gammera/gamera.mp4","type":"Video","height":368,"width":495,"duration":5121.88,"format":"video/mp4","label":{"none":["MPEG4"]}},{"id":"https://archive.org/download/gammera/gamera_512kb.mp4","type":"Video","height":368,"width":495,"duration":5121.88,"format":"video/mpeg","label":{"none":["512Kb MPEG4"]}},{"id":"https://archive.org/download/gammera/gamera.ogv","type":"Video","height":368,"width":495,"duration":5121.88,"format":"video/ogg","label":{"none":["Ogg Video"]}}]},"target":"https://iiif.archive.org/iiif/gammera/gamera/canvas"}]}]}]},"related":["https://mathewjordan.github.io/sci-fi/api/facet/director/undefined.json?sort=random","https://mathewjordan.github.io/sci-fi/api/facet/language/undefined.json?sort=random","https://mathewjordan.github.io/sci-fi/api/facet/year/1965.json?sort=random"],"seo":{"title":"Gammera the Invincible - Untitled","description":"This was the only film in the original Gamera series to be released to American theaters.
