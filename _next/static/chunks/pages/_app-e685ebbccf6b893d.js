version of this movie which exists today are actually for the movie \\"Mad Doctor of Blood Island\\" and bear no relation to this film. This comes from when they were originally intended to be released as a double feature. \\"Contrary to popular belief, this film was not directed by Kenneth G. Crane, was not made in 1970, was not produced by Toei Company, and was not titled \\"The Double Garden\\". It was originally filmed in 1966 as \\"Body of the Prey\\" and it was produced and directed by Norman Thomson. Thomson was the popular pulp novelist of the Burns Bannion series, which he wrote under his pen name \'Earl Thomson\'. The production was assisted by members of the United States military bases in Japan and shot on location there. During production, Al Rickett wrote about the making of this film in the \'Stars & Stripes\' newspaper, as well as having a small part as a gas station owner. However, while Edward D. Wood Jr. claimed he wrote the script for this film under the title \\"Venus Flytrap\\" and placed it on his resumes, reports of the making of the film in \'Stars & Stripes\' claim Thomson wrote the script. It\'s possible that Wood sold the script to Thomson and it was slightly re-written before production. It\'s undetermined if the completed film was released theatrically, in either Japan or the United States.\\" I have taken the liberty of replacing the credits with the data listed on the IMDb, footage from the Moody Institute\'s \\"Carnivorous Plants,\\" and a little music from \\"Knife of the Party.\\" I did it with my handy-dandy NERO. Since this created a NEW work under the law, despite being a simple combination of Public Domain works, I slapped a copyright notice on the back. Hack those off and the film belongs to everyone. If you don\'t, expect trouble from YouTube! The original VHS release can be downloaded from Public Domain Movie Torrents, complete with incorrect credits under the \\"Revenge of Dr. X\\" title. Whether or not Ed Wood had anything to do with this steaming dogflop of a film, it\'s certainly worthy of his name!"]}},{"id":"https://iiif.archive.org/iiif/VoyagetothePlanetofPrehistoricWomen/manifest.json","label":{"none":["Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women"]},"type":"Manifest","summary":{"none":["A team of astronauts crashes on the surface of Venus.

After directing several successful \\"El Hombre Lobo\\" romps for Naschy, Le\xf3n Klimovsky was back on hand for this undead entry, known in Spain as LA REBELION DE LAS MUERTAS. Naschy takes on two roles; an East Indian guru named Krishna and his scarred brother Kantaka, who uses some kind of voodoo to bring back the dead and haunt a redheaded British woman (Romy, who looks great in a pink nightgown) after her father gets the hatchet in the head. Like Klimovsky\'s DR. JEKYLL AND THE WOLFMAN, some of this film was shot on location in London, the city where it takes place in. Anyone expecting George Romero-inspired antics should look elsewhere.

The plot centres around a Professor (Karloff) who is to be buried with an Egyptian jewel in order to attain eternal life. When the jewel is stolen by his servant, the professor rises from the dead to reclaim it. The film, based on the play and novel by Dr. Frank King and Leonard J. Hines, was once considered to be a lost film since the original nitrate negative had succumbed to decomposition and no prints of the film were known to exist. However, an incomplete and partly decomposed Czech release print was discovered which was the only available print for several decades. Then, finally, an excellent quality print was discovered in the archives of the British Film Institute. *****NOTE ABOUT COPYRIGHT STATUS OF THIS WORK***** This version is the Czech print. This item was public domain in the US due to the ommission of a copyright notice and failure to fulfill other copyright formalities.

The first was the similarly titled, \\"Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet\\" (1962) assembled by director Curtis Harrington for producer Roger Corman. \\"Voyage to the Planet of the Prehistoric Women\\" was confabulated by Peter Bogdanovich using the pseudonym, Derek Thomas. Working under the dictum that American International would buy \\"Planet\\" if it had some women in it, he inserted new footage featuring Mamie Van Doren, a bevy of nubile cuties in white hot pants, and additional scenes from the Americanized version of another Soviet film, \\"Nebo Zovet,\\" (\\"The Heavens Beckon\\") from 1962. This film has been knocking around for years in a horribly faded version. I\'ve attempted to upgrade it by reconstructing it from the best publicly available sources. First of all, I need to disavow the bizarre story that Pathecolor was some sort of tinting process. Pathecolor was a variant of Eastmancolor (Kodak), and was capable of stunning color. The stylish Poe adaptions by Roger Corman come to mind. Unfortunately, Eastmancolor has proven to be quite unstable over the years, losing density in its yellow and cyan layers until nothing exists but a washed out magenta. The 16mm print used for the generally available transfer, is a prime example of color fading, and of a misguided attempt to equalize its color by adding cyan. The original \\"Planeta Bur\\" was probably filmed in Sovcolor (really Agfacolor from the World War II era). Though not capable of the range, subtlety or consistency of Eastmancolor, it did have a pleasing and vibrant color pallet of its own. So here is a by no means perfect, but hopefully, much better presentation of \\"Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women.\\" Thanx and a tip o\' the hat to Peter Bogdanovich, Roger Corman, Pavel Klushantsev, Mamie Van Doren, Filmgroup (for not copyrighting it!) and Robot John."]}},{"id":"https://iiif.archive.org/iiif/Nosferatu_DVD_quality/manifest.json","label":{"none":["Nosferatu_DVD_quality"]},"type":"Manifest","summary":{"none":["NOTE: THIS FILM IS SEPARATED INTO FOUR FILES Nosferatu, up elsewhere on archive.org, this is the highest resolution version up so far, a direct DVD rip, \'.vob\' files renamed \'.mpg\', no reformatting has taken place.

All subsequent entries in the series were released directly to television by American International Productions Television. Gammera the Invincible\'s American premiere was in New Orleans on December 15, 1966. Gammera the Invincible was heavily re-edited from its original Japanese version. Scenes were moved around and some were deleted completely. New footage featuring American actors was spliced in to create a more international feel and to replace scenes shot in the original cut featuring American extras with poor acting. Theses new scenes featured actors such as Albert Dekker and Brian Donlevy. The film was dubbed by Titan Productions, Inc. It features the voices of Jack Curtis and Peter Fernandez, who are best known as voices on Speed Racer and Ultraman. The film opens with Gamera\'s awakening from the accidental detonation of an atomic bomb as a result of an aerial assault by American fighters on Soviet bombers caught crossing into North American airspace. Gamera wastes no time in causing a rampage of destruction, first destroying a Japanese research ship, then making its way to Japan to wreak havoc. In an attempt to stop the giant turtle, Gamera is sedated with a freezing agent on a precipice, and powerful explosives are placed at the base. The explosion knocks the monster on its back, and while it seems as though mankind has scored a victory, this is not the case: Gamera reveals its ability to fly. A second strategy, Plan Z, is devised to stop the monster, this time by baiting it into a rocket bound for Mars.

This comes from when they were originally intended to be released as a double feature.\\n\\n\\"Contrary to popular belief, this film was not directed by Kenneth G. Crane, was not made in 1970, was not produced by Toei Company, and was not titled \\"The Double Garden\\". It was originally filmed in 1966 as \\"Body of the Prey\\" and it was produced and directed by Norman Thomson. Thomson was the popular pulp novelist of the Burns Bannion series, which he wrote under his pen name \'Earl Thomson\'. The production was assisted by members of the United States military bases in Japan and shot on location there. During production, Al Rickett wrote about the making of this film in the \'Stars & Stripes\' newspaper, as well as having a small part as a gas station owner. However, while Edward D. Wood Jr. claimed he wrote the script for this film under the title \\"Venus Flytrap\\" and placed it on his resumes, reports of the making of the film in \'Stars & Stripes\' claim Thomson wrote the script. It\'s possible that Wood sold the script to Thomson and it was slightly re-written before production. It\'s undetermined if the completed film was released theatrically, in either Japan or the United States.\\"\\n\\nI have taken the liberty of replacing the credits with the data listed on the IMDb, footage from the Moody Institute\'s \\"Carnivorous Plants,\\" and a little music from \\"Knife of the Party.\\" I did it with my handy-dandy NERO. Since this created a NEW work under the law, despite being a simple combination of Public Domain works, I slapped a copyright notice on the back. Hack those off and the film belongs to everyone. If you don\'t, expect trouble from YouTube!  The original VHS release can be downloaded from Public Domain Movie Torrents, complete with incorrect credits under the \\"Revenge of Dr. X\\" title.\\n\\nWhether or not Ed Wood had anything to do with this steaming dogflop of a film, it\'s certainly worthy of his name!"]},"rights":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/","provider":[{"id":"https://archive.org","type":"Agent","label":{"en":["The Internet Archive"]},"homepage":[{"id":"https://archive.org","type":"Text","label":{"en":["Internet Archive Homepage"]},"format":"text/html"}],"logo":[{"id":"https://archive.org/images/glogo.png","type":"Image","height":79,"width":79,"format":"image/png"}]}],"homepage":[{"id":"https://archive.org/details/BodyOfThePrey1966","type":"Text","label":{"en":["Item Page on Internet Archive"]},"format":"text/html"}],"items":[],"index":1,"slug":"body-of-the-prey"},{"@context":"http://iiif.io/api/presentation/3/context.json","id":"https://iiif.archive.org/iiif/VoyagetothePlanetofPrehistoricWomen/manifest.json","type":"Manifest","label":{"none":["Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women"]},"metadata":[{"label":{"none":["identifier"]},"value":{"none":["VoyagetothePlanetofPrehistoricWomen"]}},{"label":{"none":["title"]},"value":{"none":["Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women"]}},{"label":{"none":["creator"]},"value":{"none":["Norman D.

After directing several successful \\"El Hombre Lobo\\" romps for Naschy, Le\xf3n Klimovsky was back on hand for this undead entry, known in Spain as LA REBELION DE LAS MUERTAS. Naschy takes on two roles; an East Indian guru named Krishna and his scarred brother Kantaka, who uses some kind of voodoo to bring back the dead and haunt a redheaded British woman (Romy, who looks great in a pink nightgown) after her father gets the hatchet in the head. \\n\\nLike Klimovsky\'s DR. JEKYLL AND THE WOLFMAN, some of this film was shot on location in London, the city where it takes place in. Anyone expecting George Romero-inspired antics should look elsewhere. Klimovsky\'s zombies are mainly female actresses in black cloaks and blue face make-up who stroll around and grin a lot (they look something like the vamps in Andy Milligan\'s ultra-cheap THE BODY BENEATH). One haunting scene in which they attack a morgue attendant is somewhat reminiscent of Klimovsky\'s own WEREWOLF\'S SHADOW (as well as a scene in the first \\"Blind Dead\\" film), with the bizarre image of the pasty-faced gals mutilating his neck with the rim a soda can!"]},"rights":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/","provider":[{"id":"https://archive.org","type":"Agent","label":{"en":["The Internet Archive"]},"homepage":[{"id":"https://archive.org","type":"Text","label":{"en":["Internet Archive Homepage"]},"format":"text/html"}],"logo":[{"id":"https://archive.org/images/glogo.png","type":"Image","height":79,"width":79,"format":"image/png"}]}],"homepage":[{"id":"https://archive.org/details/Vengence_of_the_Zombies","type":"Text","label":{"en":["Item Page on Internet Archive"]},"format":"text/html"}],"items":[{"id":"https://iiif.archive.org/iiif/Vengence_of_the_Zombies/Vengence_of_the_Zombies/canvas","type":"Canvas","label":{"none":["Vengence_of_the_Zombies"]},"height":544,"width":720,"duration":5214.17,"items":[{"id":"https://iiif.archive.org/iiif/Vengence_of_the_Zombies/Vengence_of_the_Zombies/page","type":"AnnotationPage","items":[{"id":"https://iiif.archive.org/iiif/Vengence_of_the_Zombies/Vengence_of_the_Zombies/annotation","type":"Annotation","motivation":"painting","body":{"type":"Choice","items":[{"id":"https://archive.org/download/Vengence_of_the_Zombies/Vengence_of_the_Zombies_512kb.mp4","type":"Video","height":544,"width":720,"duration":5214.17,"format":"video/mpeg","label":{"none":["512Kb MPEG4"]}},{"id":"https://archive.org/download/Vengence_of_the_Zombies/Vengence_of_the_Zombies.mp4","type":"Video","height":544,"width":720,"duration":5214.17,"format":"video/mpeg","label":{"none":["h.264"]}},{"id":"https://archive.org/download/Vengence_of_the_Zombies/Vengence_of_the_Zombies.ogv","type":"Video","height":544,"width":720,"duration":5214.17,"format":"video/ogg","label":{"none":["Ogg Video"]}},{"id":"https://archive.org/download/Vengence_of_the_Zombies/Vengence_of_the_Zombies.avi","type":"Video","height":544,"width":720,"duration":5214.17,"format":"video/x-msvideo","label":{"none":["Cinepack"]}}]},"target":"https://iiif.archive.org/iiif/Vengence_of_the_Zombies/Vengence_of_the_Zombies/canvas"}]}]}],"index":41,"slug":"vengence-of-the-zombies"},{"@context":"http://iiif.io/api/presentation/3/context.json","id":"https://iiif.archive.org/iiif/TheYesterdayMachine1963/manifest.json","type":"Manifest","label":{"none":["The Yesterday Machine (1963)"]},"metadata":[{"label":{"none":["mediatype"]},"value":{"none":["movies"]}},{"label":{"none":["collection"]},"value":{"none":["SciFi_Horror","feature_films","moviesandfilms"]}},{"label":{"none":["title"]},"value":{"none":["The Yesterday Machine (1963)"]}},{"label":{"none":["subject"]},"value":{"none":["scifi;time machine;feature films"]}},{"label":{"none":["runtime"]},"value":{"none":["1:18:29"]}},{"label":{"none":["sound"]},"value":{"none":["sound"]}},{"label":{"none":["identifier"]},"value":{"none":["TheYesterdayMachine1963"]}},{"label":{"none":["addeddate"]},"value":{"none":["2010-09-20 18:02:11"]}},{"label":{"none":["ia_orig__runtime"]},"value":{"none":["78 minutes 29 seconds"]}}],"summary":{"none":["From IMDB: A Nazi scientist invents a time machine enabling him to alter the events of WWII."]},"rights":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/","provider":[{"id":"https://archive.org","type":"Agent","label":{"en":["The Internet Archive"]},"homepage":[{"id":"https://archive.org","type":"Text","label":{"en":["Internet Archive Homepage"]},"format":"text/html"}],"logo":[{"id":"https://archive.org/images/glogo.png","type":"Image","height":79,"width":79,"format":"image/png"}]}],"homepage":[{"id":"https://archive.org/details/TheYesterdayMachine1963","type":"Text","label":{"en":["Item Page on Internet Archive"]},"format":"text/html"}],"items":[],"index":42,"slug":"the-yesterday-machine-1963"},{"@context":"http://iiif.io/api/presentation/3/context.json","id":"https://iiif.archive.org/iiif/TheDisappearanceOfFlight412_MPEG/manifest.json","type":"Manifest","label":{"none":["The Disappearance Of Flight 412"]},"metadata":[{"label":{"none":["identifier"]},"value":{"none":["TheDisappearanceOfFlight412_MPEG"]}},{"label":{"none":["mediatype"]},"value":{"none":["movies"]}},{"label":{"none":["collection"]},"value":{"none":["SciFi_Horror","feature_films","moviesandfilms"]}},{"label":{"none":["creator"]},"value":{"none":["Gerald L.

These scenes, presumably shot in 16mm, were never intended for theatrical release, but crop to a 16 x 9 aspect ratio (along with the rest of the film) as though that had been a possibility. This is just about as good an image as you\'ll find on this title, but the beginning is a little rough.<div><br /></div><div><h1 class=\\"firstHeading\\" lang=\\"en\\" style=\\"font-weight:normal;margin:0px 0px 0.25em;padding:0px;border-bottom-width:1px;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-color:rgb(170,170,170);font-size:1.8em;line-height:1.3;font-family:\'Linux Libertine\', Georgia, Times, serif;background-image:none;\\" xml:lang=\\"en\\"><span><i>Creature from the Haunted Sea</i></span></h1><div class=\\"mw-body-content\\" style=\\"line-height:1.6;font-size:0.875em;color:rgb(37,37,37);font-family:sans-serif;\\"><div style=\\"font-size:13px;\\">From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</div><div style=\\"font-size:12px;line-height:1.2em;margin:0px 0px 1.4em 1em;color:rgb(84,84,84);width:auto;\\"></div><div class=\\"mw-jump\\" style=\\"height:0px;margin-top:-1.4em;margin-bottom:1.4em;\\"><a href=\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creature_from_the_Haunted_Sea#mw-navigation\\" style=\\"text-decoration:none;color:rgb(11,0,128);background-image:none;\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\"></a><a href=\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creature_from_the_Haunted_Sea#p-search\\" style=\\"text-decoration:none;color:rgb(11,0,128);background-image:none;\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\"></a></div><div lang=\\"en\\" dir=\\"ltr\\" class=\\"mw-content-ltr\\" xml:lang=\\"en\\"><table class=\\"infobox vevent\\" cellspacing=\\"3\\" style=\\"font-size:13px;border:1px solid rgb(170,170,170);color:#000000;margin:0.5em 0px 0.5em 1em;padding:0.2em;float:right;clear:right;line-height:1.5em;border-spacing:3px;width:22em;background-color:rgb(249,249,249);\\"><tbody><tr><th colspan=\\"2\\" class=\\"summary\\" style=\\"vertical-align:top;text-align:center;font-size:14px;font-style:italic;\\">Creature from the Haunted Sea</th></tr><tr><td colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"vertical-align:top;text-align:center;\\"><a href=\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Creature_from_the_Haunted_Sea_poster.jpg\\" class=\\"image\\" style=\\"text-decoration:none;color:rgb(11,0,128);background:none;\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\"><img alt=\\"Creature from the Haunted Sea poster.jpg\\" src=\\"//web.archive.org/web/2im_/http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4e/Creature_from_the_Haunted_Sea_poster.jpg/220px-Creature_from_the_Haunted_Sea_poster.jpg\\" width=\\"220\\" height=\\"419\\" class=\\"thumbborder\\" style=\\"border:1px solid rgb(221,221,221);vertical-align:middle;\\" /></a><div style=\\"font-size:12px;line-height:1.5em;\\">Theatrical release poster</div></td></tr><tr><th style=\\"vertical-align:top;white-space:nowrap;\\">Directed by</th><td style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"><a href=\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Corman\\" title=\\"Roger Corman\\" style=\\"text-decoration:none;color:rgb(11,0,128);background:none;\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">Roger Corman</a></td></tr><tr><th style=\\"vertical-align:top;white-space:nowrap;\\">Produced by</th><td style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"><a href=\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Corman\\" title=\\"Roger Corman\\" style=\\"text-decoration:none;color:rgb(11,0,128);background:none;\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">Roger Corman</a><br /><a href=\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Hannawalt\\" title=\\"Charles Hannawalt\\" style=\\"text-decoration:none;color:rgb(11,0,128);background:none;\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">Charles Hannawalt</a></td></tr><tr><th style=\\"vertical-align:top;white-space:nowrap;\\">Written by</th><td style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"><a href=\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_B._Griffith\\" title=\\"Charles B.

Lieutenant Andre Duvalier (Jack Nicholson) has been accidentally separated from his regiment. He is wandering near the coast when he sees a young woman (Sandra Knight) and asks her for directions to Coldon, where he hopes to rejoin his regiment. But the woman doesn\'t answer, doesn\'t even greet him and walks away. Eventually she takes him towards the sea, where she disappears in rough water. Andre loses consciousness while trying to follow her, and is attacked by a bird and awakes in a house where an old woman (Dorothy Neumann) claims never to have seen the woman. After he leaves, he sees the woman again, and while trying to follow her, is saved by a man from certain death. Andre learns that in order to help the girl, he must go to castle of Baron Von Leppe (Boris Karloff), and when he arrives, Andre sees the woman looking out of a window. However, Baron Von Leppe is old and seems reluctant to let Andre in. He claims there\'s no woman in the castle, but shows Andre a painting which does indeed portray her. Andre learns that she is the Baroness, who died twenty years ago. What is the baron\'s secret?

There\'s a Vampire called Nosferatu, a living mummy, a Frankenstein wanna-be called \\"The \\"Faranksalon\\" (literally \\"Franken-science\\") Monster and the wolfman played by Naschy. \\n\\nCompletely bizarre movie mixing science fiction with gothic horror.\\nIt seems to be trying to recapture the feel of Universal\'s House of Frankenstein/Dracula formula rather than imitate Hammer, as European horror\'s often do.

The 700mb file is better quality and resolution."]},"rights":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/","provider":[{"id":"https://archive.org","type":"Agent","label":{"en":["The Internet

(obviously London), a city threatened by world war. Pacifist intellectuals, such as John Cabal (Massey), try to turn the tide. But Cabal\'s efforts go unheeded by the self-interested classes, and war arrives with tanks and aeroplanes and gas bombs. Everytown is destroyed by air raids (dramatically enacted four years before the real thing).The war continues for thirty years, its original purpose forgotten. As a result, civilization degenerates while \\"the Wandering Sickness\\" and devastation accelerate the spiral down until 1970, when the world has crumbled into a balkanized \\"Mad Max\\" Dark Ages. Everytown is ruled by a barbaric warlord, the Boss (Ralph Richardson), as the war continues on a Medieval scale.\\n<br /><a href=\\"http://ia300203.us.archive.org/0/items/things_to_come_ipod_version/Things_To_Come.flv\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">FLV file</a>\\n<br /><a href=\\"http://ia300203.us.archive.org/0/items/things_to_come_ipod_version/video.html\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">web page</a><br />\\nOriginally Submitted by: www.k-otic.com"]},"rights":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/","provider":[{"id":"https://archive.org","type":"Agent","label":{"en":["The Internet Archive"]},"homepage":[{"id":"https://archive.org","type":"Text","label":{"en":["Internet Archive Homepage"]},"format":"text/html"}],"logo":[{"id":"https://archive.org/images/glogo.png","type":"Image","height":79,"width":79,"format":"image/png"}]}],"homepage":[{"id":"https://archive.org/details/things_to_come_ipod_version","type":"Text","label":{"en":["Item Page on Internet Archive"]},"format":"text/html"}],"items":[{"id":"https://iiif.archive.org/iiif/things_to_come_ipod_version/things_to_come/canvas","type":"Canvas","label":{"none":["things_to_come"]},"height":240,"width":320,"duration":5571.29,"items":[{"id":"https://iiif.archive.org/iiif/things_to_come_ipod_version/things_to_come/page","type":"AnnotationPage","items":[{"id":"https://iiif.archive.org/iiif/things_to_come_ipod_version/things_to_come/annotation","type":"Annotation","motivation":"painting","body":{"type":"Choice","items":[{"id":"https://archive.org/download/things_to_come_ipod_version/things_to_come.mp4","type":"Video","height":240,"width":320,"duration":5571.29,"format":"video/mp4","label":{"none":["MPEG4"]}},{"id":"https://archive.org/download/things_to_come_ipod_version/things_to_come_512kb.mp4","type":"Video","height":240,"width":320,"duration":5571.29,"format":"video/mpeg","label":{"none":["512Kb MPEG4"]}},{"id":"https://archive.org/download/things_to_come_ipod_version/things_to_come.ogv","type":"Video","height":240,"width":320,"duration":5571.29,"format":"video/ogg","label":{"none":["Ogg Video"]}}]},"target":"https://iiif.archive.org/iiif/things_to_come_ipod_version/things_to_come/canvas"}]}]}],"index":325,"slug":"things-to-come-3"},{"@context":"http://iiif.io/api/presentation/3/context.json","id":"https://iiif.archive.org/iiif/NonStopNewYork1937/manifest.json","type":"Manifest","label":{"none":["Non Stop New York 1937"]},"metadata":[{"label":{"none":["mediatype"]},"value":{"none":["movies"]}},{"label":{"none":["collection"]},"value":{"none":["SciFi_Horror","feature_films","moviesandfilms"]}},{"label":{"none":["title"]},"value":{"none":["Non Stop New York 1937"]}},{"label":{"none":["subject"]},"value":{"none":["scifi;airliner;feature films"]}},{"label":{"none":["runtime"]},"value":{"none":["1:11:55"]}},{"label":{"none":["sound"]},"value":{"none":["sound"]}},{"label":{"none":["identifier"]},"value":{"none":["NonStopNewYork1937"]}},{"label":{"none":["addeddate"]},"value":{"none":["2009-08-21 17:33:03"]}},{"label":{"none":["ia_orig__runtime"]},"value":{"none":["71 minutes 55 seconds"]}}],"summary":{"none":["Anna Lee is a stowaway on a futuristic airliner.

Has a lot of stock footage lifted from old trailers for Star Wars, The Magic Sword and others; While also displaying costumes that resemble Flash Gordon\'s Ming, Star Wars\' Darth Vader and Galactica\'s Cylon Centurions. Two star are defending Earth in a space battle and are shot down on a desert planet where they find a cantina full of rubber masked aliens and people living under slave conditions. There is a sort of rubber version of Robby The Robot who is the enforcer for the Ming like ruler. Many of the padded rubber costumes recall the movie Super Inframan and it has an overall similar feel. There are explosions happening everywhere the characters turn and some very strange martial arts type fight and then some living mummy\'s actually show up in an Indiana Jones-like cave sequence. \\nNot a very good print. The sound goes out of sync in places. Sorry. There probably aren\'t any good prints as this is known to be an \\"abandoned\\" film.

When the jewel is stolen by his servant, the professor rises from the dead to reclaim it.\\n\\nThe film, based on the play and novel by Dr. Frank King and Leonard J. Hines, was once considered to be a lost film since the original nitrate negative had succumbed to decomposition and no prints of the film were known to exist. However, an incomplete and partly decomposed Czech release print was discovered which was the only available print for several decades. Then, finally, an excellent quality print was discovered in the archives of the British Film Institute.\\n\\n*****NOTE ABOUT COPYRIGHT STATUS OF THIS WORK*****\\nThis version is the Czech print. This item was public domain in the US due to the ommission of a copyright notice and failure to fulfill other copyright formalities. The item remains in the US public domain due to it\'s public domain status under UK law at the relevant date of GATT/URAA (1 January 1996) rendering it ineligible for restoration of copyright. Transitional terms of UK Copyright legislation stipulate that the copyright term for this film continues to be calculated under the terms of the 1911 UK Copyright Act. This film was released in the UK in 1933. Under the terms of the law at the time, Cinematograph Films were protected as a series of \\"Photographs\\" with a term of 50 years copyright from the date of publication, a \\"sound recording\\" with a copyright term of 50 years from recording or publication and a dramatic work of collective authorship with a copyright term of 50 calendar years from the death of the first deceased principal author or the passing of the actual calendar year of the death of the last surviving principal author. The first principle author to die was director T Hayes Hunter (1884-1944). All other principle authors died within 50 years of T Hayes Hunter. As such, under UK Copyright law the film entered the public domain at midnight on 31 December 1994."]},"rights":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/","provider":[{"id":"https://archive.org","type":"Agent","label":{"en":["The Internet Archive"]},"homepage":[{"id":"https://archive.org","type":"Text","label":{"en":["Internet Archive Homepage"]},"format":"text/html"}],"logo":[{"id":"https://archive.org/images/glogo.png","type":"Image","height":79,"width":79,"format":"image/png"}]}],"homepage":[{"id":"https://archive.org/details/TheGhoul","type":"Text","label":{"en":["Item Page on Internet Archive"]},"format":"text/html"}],"items":[{"id":"https://iiif.archive.org/iiif/TheGhoul/TheGhoul_1933/canvas","type":"Canvas","label":{"none":["TheGhoul_1933"]},"height":480,"width":640,"duration":4127.3,"items":[{"id":"https://iiif.archive.org/iiif/TheGhoul/TheGhoul_1933/page","type":"AnnotationPage","items":[{"id":"https://iiif.archive.org/iiif/TheGhoul/TheGhoul_1933/annotation","type":"Annotation","motivation":"painting","body":{"type":"Choice","items":[{"id":"https://archive.org/download/TheGhoul/TheGhoul_1933_512kb.mp4","type":"Video","height":480,"width":640,"duration":4127.3,"format":"video/mpeg","label":{"none":["512Kb MPEG4"]}},{"id":"https://archive.org/download/TheGhoul/TheGhoul_1933.mp4","type":"Video","height":480,"width":640,"duration":4127.3,"format":"video/mpeg","label":{"none":["h.264"]}},{"id":"https://archive.org/download/TheGhoul/TheGhoul_1933.ogv","type":"Video","height":480,"width":640,"duration":4127.3,"format":"video/ogg","label":{"none":["Ogg Video"]}},{"id":"https://archive.org/download/TheGhoul/TheGhoul_1933.WMV","type":"Video","height":480,"width":640,"duration":4127.3,"format":"application/octet-stream","label":{"none":["Windows Media"]}}]},"target":"https://iiif.archive.org/iiif/TheGhoul/TheGhoul_1933/canvas"}]}]}],"index":357,"slug":"the-ghoul"},{"@context":"http://iiif.io/api/presentation/3/context.json","id":"https://iiif.archive.org/iiif/Dementia131963/manifest.json","type":"Manifest","label":{"none":["Dementia 13 (1963)"]},"metadata":[{"label":{"none":["mediatype"]},"value":{"none":["movies"]}},{"label":{"none":["collection"]},"value":{"none":["SciFi_Horror","feature_films","moviesandfilms"]}},{"label":{"none":["title"]},"value":{"none":["Dementia 13 (1963)"]}},{"label":{"none":["subject"]},"value":{"none":["dementia 13; francis ford coppolla; roger corman; horror"]}},{"label":{"none":["runtime"]},"value":{"none":["1:14:50"]}},{"label":{"none":["sound"]},"value":{"none":["sound"]}},{"label":{"none":["identifier"]},"value":{"none":["Dementia131963"]}},{"label":{"none":["addeddate"]},"value":{"none":["2010-10-25 02:22:14"]}},{"label":{"none":["ia_orig__runtime"]},"value":{"none":["74 minutes 50 seconds"]}}],"summary":{"none":["Directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Roger Corman, Dementia 13 is the story of a greedy young woman who marries into money, but stands to loose it all when her husband dies.

to the Planet of the Prehistoric Women\\" (1968) is the second of two reworkings of \\"Planeta Bur,\\" a Soviet sci-fi film from 1959. The first was the similarly titled, \\"Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet\\" (1962) assembled by director Curtis Harrington for producer Roger Corman.</div><div><br /></div><div>\\"Voyage to the Planet of the Prehistoric Women\\" was confabulated by Peter Bogdanovich using the pseudonym, Derek Thomas. Working under the dictum that American International would buy \\"Planet\\" if it had some women in it, he inserted new footage featuring Mamie Van Doren, a bevy of nubile cuties in white hot pants, and additional scenes from the Americanized version of another Soviet film, \\"Nebo Zovet,\\" (\\"The Heavens Beckon\\") from 1962.</div><div><br /></div><div>This film has been knocking around for years in a horribly faded version. I\'ve attempted to upgrade it by reconstructing it from the best publicly available sources.</div><div><br /></div><div>First of all, I need to disavow the bizarre story that Pathecolor was some sort of tinting process. Pathecolor was a variant of Eastmancolor (Kodak), and was capable of stunning color. The stylish Poe adaptions by Roger Corman come to mind. Unfortunately, Eastmancolor has proven to be quite unstable over the years, losing density in its yellow and cyan layers until nothing exists but a washed out magenta. The 16mm print used for the generally available transfer, is a prime example of color fading, and of a misguided attempt to equalize its color by adding cyan.</div><div><br /></div><div>The original \\"Planeta Bur\\" was probably filmed in Sovcolor (really Agfacolor from the World War II era). Though not capable of the range, subtlety or consistency of Eastmancolor, it did have a pleasing and vibrant color pallet of its own.</div><div><br /></div><div>So here is a by no means perfect, but hopefully, much better presentation of \\"Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women.\\"</div><div><br /></div><div>Thanx and a tip o\' the hat to Peter Bogdanovich, Roger Corman, Pavel Klushantsev, Mamie Van Doren, Filmgroup (for not copyrighting it!) and Robot John.</div>"]},"rights":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/","provider":[{"id":"https://archive.org","type":"Agent","label":{"en":["The Internet Archive"]},"homepage":[{"id":"https://archive.org","type":"Text","label":{"en":["Internet Archive Homepage"]},"format":"text/html"}],"logo":[{"id":"https://archive.org/images/glogo.png","type":"Image","height":79,"width":79,"format":"image/png"}]}],"homepage":[{"id":"https://archive.org/details/VoyageToThePlanetOfPrehistoricWomen_20130813","type":"Text","label":{"en":["Item Page on Internet Archive"]},"format":"text/html"}],"items":[{"id":"https://iiif.archive.org/iiif/VoyageToThePlanetOfPrehistoricWomen_20130813/Voyage-to-the-Planet-of-Prehistoric-Women/canvas","type":"Canvas","label":{"none":["Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women"]},"height":480,"width":640,"duration":4791.17,"items":[{"id":"https://iiif.archive.org/iiif/VoyageToThePlanetOfPrehistoricWomen_20130813/Voyage-to-the-Planet-of-Prehistoric-Women/page","type":"AnnotationPage","items":[{"id":"https://iiif.archive.org/iiif/VoyageToThePlanetOfPrehistoricWomen_20130813/Voyage-to-the-Planet-of-Prehistoric-Women/annotation","type":"Annotation","motivation":"painting","body":{"type":"Choice","items":[{"id":"https://archive.org/download/VoyageToThePlanetOfPrehistoricWomen_20130813/Voyage%20to%20the%20Planet%20of%20Prehistoric%20Women.mpg","type":"Video","height":480,"width":640,"duration":4791.17,"format":"video/mpeg","label":{"none":["MPEG2"]}},{"id":"https://archive.org/download/VoyageToThePlanetOfPrehistoricWomen_20130813/Voyage%20to%20the%20Planet%20of%20Prehistoric%20Women.mp4","type":"Video","height":480,"width":640,"duration":4791.17,"format":"video/mpeg","label":{"none":["h.264"]}},{"id":"https://archive.org/download/VoyageToThePlanetOfPrehistoricWomen_20130813/Voyage%20to%20the%20Planet%20of%20Prehistoric%20Women.ogv","type":"Video","height":480,"width":640,"duration":4791.17,"format":"video/ogg","label":{"none":["Ogg Video"]}}]},"target":"https://iiif.archive.org/iiif/VoyageToThePlanetOfPrehistoricWomen_20130813/Voyage-to-the-Planet-of-Prehistoric-Women/canvas"}]}]}],"index":372,"slug":"voyage-to-the-planet-of-prehistoric-women-2"},{"@context":"http://iiif.io/api/presentation/3/context.json","id":"https://iiif.archive.org/iiif/Nosferatu_DVD_quality/manifest.json","type":"Manifest","label":{"none":["Nosferatu_DVD_quality"]},"metadata":[{"label":{"none":["identifier"]},"value":{"none":["Nosferatu_DVD_quality"]}},{"label":{"none":["title"]},"value":{"none":["Nosferatu_DVD_quality"]}},{"label":{"none":["mediatype"]},"value":{"none":["movies"]}},{"label":{"none":["collection"]},"value":{"none":["silent_films","SciFi_Horror","feature_films","moviesandfilms"]}},{"label":{"none":["date"]},"value":{"none":["1922"]}},{"label":{"none":["year"]},"value":{"none":["1922"]}},{"label":{"none":["subject"]},"value":{"none":["nosferatu vampire vampires murnau"]}},{"label":{"none":["addeddate"]},"value":{"none":["2007-12-06 17:39:19"]}},{"label":{"none":["updater"]},"value":{"none":["killer_09","twainbough","killer_09"]}},{"label":{"none":["updatedate"]},"value":{"none":["2007-12-06 17:48:52","2007-12-22 20:25:25","2008-01-10 20:53:10"]}},{"label":{"none":["sound"]},"value":{"none":["sound"]}},{"label":{"none":["color"]},"value":{"none":["color"]}},{"label":{"none":["rights"]},"value":{"none":["this film was released in 1922 and is therefore no longer eligible for copyright."]}},{"label":{"none":["language"]},"value":{"none":["English"]}}],"summary":{"none":["NOTE: THIS FILM IS SEPARATED INTO FOUR FILES\\n\\nNosferatu, up elsewhere on archive.org, this is the highest resolution version up so far, a direct DVD rip, \'.vob\' files renamed \'.mpg\', no reformatting has taken place.

A silent feature.\\n\\nDick Bannister is the new field boss of the Ford Logging Company, a Canadian logging-crew during a time when conflicts with the powerful Consolidated Lumber Company, a bitter rival company, have turned bloody, like a private war. His boss, Miss Edith Ford, comes to inspect the lumberjack camp, bringing her doctor fianc\xc3\xa9 with her. Dick is attacked by his rivals and left for dead. His loss of blood is so great that he needs a transfusion, but no human will volunteer, so the surgeon uses a wolf as a source of the blood.

But this wasn\'t enough: The widow of Bram Stoker won two lawsuits (1924 and 1929) in which she demanded the destruction of all copies of the movie, however happily copies of it were already too widespread to destroy them all. Later, Universal studios could break her resistance against this movie.

Casting an ominous shadow over the townspeople who dare not look upon it, the unholy dwelling is home to one Count Orlok (Max Schreck) , an undead night creature with a taste for human blood.\\n\\nInto this picture steps Hutter, an unwary traveler who visits the Count. He carries with him the deed for a property Orlock wishes to buy in Hutter\'s home town of Wisborg.\\n\\nThat night, in preparation for the long sea voyage ahead, the vampire hastily loads his coffin aboard ship and waits...\\n\\nOnce at sea, Orlock bares his fangs and upon arrival in Wisborg, leaves behind a floating morgue. Now, preparing to feast on the citizens, the cadaveous Count, prowls the darkness as the eerie Nosferatu."]},"provider":[{"id":"https://archive.org","type":"Agent","label":{"en":["The Internet Archive"]},"homepage":[{"id":"https://archive.org","type":"Text","label":{"en":["Internet Archive Homepage"]},"format":"text/html"}],"logo":[{"id":"https://archive.org/images/glogo.png","type":"Image","height":79,"width":79,"format":"image/png"}]}],"homepage":[{"id":"https://archive.org/details/Nosferatu_most_complete_version_93_mins.","type":"Text","label":{"en":["Item Page on Internet Archive"]},"format":"text/html"}],"items":[],"index":431,"slug":"nosferatu-eine-symphonie-des-grauens-a-symphony-of-horror"},{"@context":"http://iiif.io/api/presentation/3/context.json","id":"https://iiif.archive.org/iiif/Killers_from_space/manifest.json","type":"Manifest","label":{"none":["Killers From Space"]},"metadata":[{"label":{"none":["identifier"]},"value":{"none":["Killers_from_space"]}},{"label":{"none":["title"]},"value":{"none":["Killers From Space"]}},{"label":{"none":["mediatype"]},"value":{"none":["movies"]}},{"label":{"none":["collection"]},"value":{"none":["SciFi_Horror","feature_films","moviesandfilms"]}},{"label":{"none":["date"]},"value":{"none":["1954"]}},{"label":{"none":["year"]},"value":{"none":["1954"]}},{"label":{"none":["subject"]},"value":{"none":["Science Fiction"]}},{"label":{"none":["pick"]},"value":{"none":["1"]}},{"label":{"none":["addeddate"]},"value":{"none":["2005-06-20 23:53:40"]}},{"label":{"none":["adder"]},"value":{"none":["moxey"]}},{"label":{"none":["updater"]},"value":{"none":["AV Geek Skip","ARossi","jordonz","twainbough"]}},{"label":{"none":["updatedate"]},"value":{"none":["2005-06-21 09:34:37","2007-05-22 19:30:15","2008-05-15 17:27:17","2009-03-10 16:56:11"]}},{"label":{"none":["director"]},"value":{"none":["W.

It was originally presented in America by World Entertainment Corp. and Harris Associates, Inc. who re-named the film Gammera the Invincible. All subsequent entries in the series were released directly to television by American International Productions Television. Gammera the Invincible\'s American premiere was in New Orleans on December 15, 1966. Gammera the Invincible was heavily re-edited from its original Japanese version. Scenes were moved around and some were deleted completely. New footage featuring American actors was spliced in to create a more international feel and to replace scenes shot in the original cut featuring American extras with poor acting. Theses new scenes featured actors such as Albert Dekker and Brian Donlevy. The film was dubbed by Titan Productions, Inc. It features the voices of Jack Curtis and Peter Fernandez, who are best known as voices on Speed Racer and Ultraman.\\n\\nThe film opens with Gamera\'s awakening from the accidental detonation of an atomic bomb as a result of an aerial assault by American fighters on Soviet bombers caught crossing into North American airspace. Gamera wastes no time in causing a rampage of destruction, first destroying a Japanese research ship, then making its way to Japan to wreak havoc. In an attempt to stop the giant turtle, Gamera is sedated with a freezing agent on a precipice, and powerful explosives are placed at the base. The explosion knocks the monster on its back, and while it seems as though mankind has scored a victory, this is not the case: Gamera reveals its ability to fly. A second strategy, Plan Z, is devised to stop the monster, this time by baiting it into a rocket bound for Mars. The plan is successful and the Earth is safe from Gamera."]},"rights":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/","provider":[{"id":"https://archive.org","type":"Agent","label":{"en":["The Internet Archive"]},"homepage":[{"id":"https://archive.org","type":"Text","label":{"en":["Internet Archive Homepage"]},"format":"text/html"}],"logo":[{"id":"https://archive.org/images/glogo.png","type":"Image","height":79,"width":79,"format":"image/png"}]}],"homepage":[{"id":"https://archive.org/details/gammera","type":"Text","label":{"en":["Item Page on Internet Archive"]},"format":"text/html"}],"items":[{"id":"https://iiif.archive.org/iiif/gammera/gamera/canvas","type":"Canvas","label":{"none":["gamera"]},"height":368,"width":495,"duration":5121.88,"items":[{"id":"https://iiif.archive.org/iiif/gammera/gamera/page","type":"AnnotationPage","items":[{"id":"https://iiif.archive.org/iiif/gammera/gamera/annotation","type":"Annotation","motivation":"painting","body":{"type":"Choice","items":[{"id":"https://archive.org/download/gammera/gamera.mp4","type":"Video","height":368,"width":495,"duration":5121.88,"format":"video/mp4","label":{"none":["MPEG4"]}},{"id":"https://archive.org/download/gammera/gamera_512kb.mp4","type":"Video","height":368,"width":495,"duration":5121.88,"format":"video/mpeg","label":{"none":["512Kb MPEG4"]}},{"id":"https://archive.org/download/gammera/gamera.ogv","type":"Video","height":368,"width":495,"duration":5121.88,"format":"video/ogg","label":{"none":["Ogg Video"]}}]},"target":"https://iiif.archive.org/iiif/gammera/gamera/canvas"}]}]}],"index":445,"slug":"gammera-the-invincible"},{"@context":"http://iiif.io/api/presentation/3/context.json","id":"https://iiif.archive.org/iiif/tormented/manifest.json","type":"Manifest","label":{"none":["Tormented"]},"metadata":[{"label":{"none":["identifier"]},"value":{"none":["tormented"]}},{"label":{"none":["title"]},"value":{"none":["Tormented"]}},{"label":{"none":["creator"]},"value":{"none":["Bert I.
